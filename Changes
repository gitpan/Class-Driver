Revision history for Perl extension Class::Driver.

0.005  Thu Feb 16 09:37:00 2006
    - Trivial change; we now depend on Sub::Uplevel since some automated
      builders/testers on testers.cpan.org & ppm.activestate.com aren't
      picking up on it themselves.

    - Applied a patch from Ron Savage [http://search.cpan.org/~rsavage/] that
      fixed some incredibly bad spelling on my part.
    - Depend on Class::Clone 0.05, since it has it's dependancies and use
      of Exporter.pm fixed. This should allow this package to build with
      dependancies and pass tests under perl 5.6.

0.003  Mon Jan  9 14:51:00 2006
    - Got rid of a "variable redefined" warning that crept into Driver.pm.
    - Explicitly require Test-Exception 0.20, imacat's smoke tester seems
      to be getting confused about who needs Sub::Uplevel (I need
      Test::Exception, Test::Exception needs Sub::Uplevel).

0.002  Sat Dec 17 15:06:00 2005
    - Fixed inaccurate dependancies

0.001  Mon Dec  5 12:22:32 2005
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
        -AXP -b 5.6.0 Class::Driver
