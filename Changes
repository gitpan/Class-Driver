Revision history for Perl extension Class::Driver.

0.003  Mon Jan  9 14:51:00 2006
    - Got rid of a "variable redefined" warning that crept into Driver.pm.
    - Explicitly require Test-Exception 0.20, imacat's smoke tester seems
      to be getting confused about who needs Sub::Uplevel (I need
      Test::Exception, Test::Exception needs Sub::Uplevel).

0.002  Sat Dec 17 15:06:00 2005
    - Fixed inaccurate dependancies

0.001  Mon Dec  5 12:22:32 2005

        -AXP -b 5.6.0 Class::Driver
